HTML Structure
The HTML structure of the website is organized into sections. Each section corresponds to a different part of the website. Here's a brief overview of the sections:

Header (l-header): Contains the navigation menu with links to different sections of the website.

Home (home): The landing section of the website that introduces the designer and includes a call-to-action button for contacting.

About (about): Provides information about the designer, including a photo and a brief description.

Resume (resume): Displays professional skills and a progress bar for HTML, CSS, Python, and UX/UI design. Also includes an image.

Works (work): Showcases the designer's work with images.

Gallery (gallery): A section that displays images, possibly related to the designer's work or interests.

Contact (contact): Includes a contact form with fields for name, email, and a message, as well as a send button.

Footer: Contains copyright information.

CSS Styles
The CSS styles are defined within the HTML document using a <style> tag and a :root declaration to define global variables for colors, fonts, and other properties. The styles are used to control the layout, fonts, colors, and responsiveness of the website.

JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code provides functionality for the website, including the following:

Mobile Menu: It allows the navigation menu to be hidden on mobile devices and displayed when clicking the menu icon.

Navigation Links: It ensures that when a navigation link is clicked, the mobile menu closes.

Scroll Animation: It uses the ScrollReveal library to create scroll animations for various elements on the website. This gives a smooth and engaging user experience as elements appear as the user scrolls down the page.
